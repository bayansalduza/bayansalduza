### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

   I studied at a university suitable for my interest in
   technology, innovations, software, curiosity and career
   planning, and gained my first professional work
   experience in the software industry in 2020. I have
   about 2 year working experience. I played an active role
   in many technologies and projects. Coca Cola CCI,
   Electronic Signature, micro service architectures and
   many projects are among them. I have been involved in
   .NET Core and .NET Framework projects many times. I
   am accustomed to English terms and software
